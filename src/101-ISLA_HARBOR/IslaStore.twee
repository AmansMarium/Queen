:: IslaStore
This general store has seen better times but despite its obviously ancient age it is kept fastidously clean by its proprieter. Rows of well-organized shelves and wooden bins line the walls. While the selection of goods isn't expansive by any means, it's still the best stocked shop in Isla Harbor.
