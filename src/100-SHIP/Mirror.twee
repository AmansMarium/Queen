:: Mirror [no-teleport]
This is a well-used full length mirror. Unlike most mirrors you've seen, it's actually made out of silvered glass instead of simple polished metal. Such a valuable piece looks entirely out of place in this ramshackle room, and so you're given to assume the its expense implies that Captain Reginald and his crew of degenerate bungholers expect you to look appropriately presentable.
