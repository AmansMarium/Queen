:: Cargo [no-teleport]
The cargo hold of The Salty Mermaid is a dank and musty area shrounded in a dismal gloom. Untidy rows of crates and barrels line the floors, each overflowing with a jumbled assortment of plundered goods. Most of the merchandise looks like worthless rubbish but you suppose never know what you'll find if you look long enough.
