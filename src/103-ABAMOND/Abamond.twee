:: Abamond
The sole pier on Abamond is a megalith, referred to by the locals as the @@color:gold;'Lonely Pier'@@. It is a structure of unknown origins that has been around for longer than anyone remembers and hints at the previously 'occupied' nature of this now desolate island. From the sandy shale of this beach you can see a vast jungle ahead of you, denser than you could have possibly imagined a jungle could be, and to the north the beach stretches out along the coast to a stark rock face that looks to have been hewed out of stone by the force of the waves.
