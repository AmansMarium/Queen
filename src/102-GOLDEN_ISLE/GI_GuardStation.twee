:: GI_GuardStation
This barricaded guard station separates the lower @@color:gold;'Portside'@@ district from the more affluent @@color:gold;'High Hill'@@. It is manned \
all hours of the day and night by a special militia that is loyal to the current ruler of the island, @@color:cyan;'Black Bertie'@@, a pirate with a \
reputation so fearsome that few utter to whisper her name without a look over their shoulder. Set back from the main portcullis is a small Gaol, used \
to temporarily store prisoners. The island has no need for more robust facilities, as criminals among pirates are usually either killed or simply \
pressed into service on a passing vessel.
